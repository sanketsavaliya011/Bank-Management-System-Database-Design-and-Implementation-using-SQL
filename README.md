# Bank-Management-System-Database-Design-and-Implementation-using-SQL

# Task 1. Design a database system for a bank. This bank can have several branches. In addition,
any branch can have many clients. Also, any client can have, maximum, 10 accounts.
Moreover, the clients can transfer money to their own accounts as well as to any other
account (in this bank). You need to describe all the entities and attributes. In addition, by
providing your own supportive reasons, you are requested to choose the proper DBMS
(Relational or Non-Relational).

# Task 2. Draw an ER Diagram for your database. Describe all possible schemas. Also, define all
the tables (including attributes) and specify the types and length using SQL commands (your
tables need to be filled by some meaningful data). Write, at least, eight SQL queries and
explain the output of the queries*. Note that these eight queries must be complementary
for/to each other in the form that they collectively shape a report. This means that they should
not be structurally the same (with the same purpose).

# TASK 3. Describe and analyse CAP theorem as well as the important factors that affect the
efficiency of your database (e.g., Transactions, Consistency, Scalability).
